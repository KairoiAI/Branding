Above, you can find the images used across Kairoi's website. They have been adapted – in line with their respective licences – to best render on the website.

Adaptations have been made as follows.

## Header images
These are used at the top of pages and blog posts, as backgrounds to titles.
* **Size:** 1920 x 640 pixels, after cropping if necessary.
* **Colour:** For pages, they have been made black and white; for blog posts, they are made a darker shade that contrasts better with the title in white

## Blog thumbnails
These are used for displaying the image above the post's excerpt on different pages.
* **Size:** 480 x 360 pixels, after cropping if necessary

## Attribution
Above, each image's title and author is stated underneath "Name", and their respective licences underneath "Last commit".

## ALT Text
On the website, images must _always_ be described by ALT text.
